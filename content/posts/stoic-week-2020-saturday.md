## Morning {#morning}

> Be like the headland, on which the waves break constantly, which still stands firm, while the foaming waters are put to rest around it. ‘It is my bad luck that this has happened to me.’ On the contrary, say, ‘It is my good luck that, although this has happened to me, I can bear it without getting upset, neither crushed by the present nor afraid of the future.’ This kind of event could have happened to anyone, but not everyone would have borne it without getting upset. – Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 4.49

Can you really be happy even though the world seems to suck around you? I used to struggle with the idea that Stoicism leads to happiness, because if I'm honest, indeed the end-goal for me in any philosophy is to be happy in a lasting kind-of way. Stoicism makes no claim that it will fix the world for you, indeed your kids will still hate going to bed, you and your wife will still have conflicts, and things are generally going to continue to suck all around you. Stoicism shuns this kind of happiness (the idea that things will suddenly start going good for you in relation to the outside world) as foolish, because, as you may know by now, you cannot control the world no matter what you do.

But, I've alluded to it in my earlier writings, that the kind of happiness that you have control over is the happiness you feel about _yourself_, e.g. when you look into the mirror. That is your business, that's all you should really work on. And, of course, if the world chooses not to suck around you at time, enjoying life's simple and free joys is totally okay. 

But, I think early on in my Stoicism I had this idea that if I fixed _me_ all these things would stop sucking, but that _never came true_ (and it never will). The only thing that hopefully changes is that you react differently (or not react at all in some cases) to the world sucking around you. But, the sucky world is still going to hammer down on you, and the Stoics make it pretty clear that you have to simply not let that get to you, and I think that's what this passage means. I think that's what Courage (a core Stoic virtue) means.

The world still sucks when you become a Stoic, and as you improve as a Stoic. Nothing fixes that, that's the point right. That's the human condition. Let the world be the world, and you change _you_ so that it doesn't rope what you _can_ control into it's suckiness.
