## Morning {#morning}

> Morning Text for Reflection
>
> The wise person does nothing that he could regret, nothing against his will, but does everything honourably, consistently, seriously, and rightly; he anticipates nothing as if it is bound to happen, but is shocked by nothing when it does happen …. and refers everything to his own judgement, and stands by his own decisions. I can conceive of nothing which is happier that this. – Cicero, Tusculan Disputations 5.81

> _Perfection is the enemy of good._

I've always liked that saying, we say it a lot in the developer-world, as the puersuit of perfection often distracts us from getting something good done instead. I've always, somewhat, disliked the idea of _[the Sage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sage_(philosophy))_ in Stoicism, because in the past I used to obsess over the idea of perfection and all I got from that was the constant diss-appointment of falling short. I think the first task of the Stoic is to admit they will fall short, otherwise how can they even _be_ a Stoic.

This is why I love Marcus Aurelius so much, because it's obvious he thought he was flawed, that he _too_ fell short. I think it's important to realize that a _part of being a Stoic_ is failing and falling short. Stoicism wouldn't exist if we didn't fail to be happy _all the time_. I always try and remember, too, that even the one's we venerate, i.e. _the big four_, were likely also flawed, what skeletons did they have in their closets?

Like [Jason Fried](https://m.signalvnoise.com/ive-never-had-a-goal/), I think it's un-wise to have goals and statuses to achieve, e.g. _I am not free from desire_. I scoff as I write that, lol. Instead I think if you continue to work at being a Stoic just for the sheer _fun_ of it, because you _like_ being a Stoic, is more important. Otherwise, you grow dis-satisfied and burnt-out.

Being happy is tricky, but I've always been convinced that I'm the only one in the way of finding happiness. That my own mind, imagination, and cravings are all I need to learn to control. That's why Stoicism appealed so much to me. The idea that you could get out of your own way, and be happy gave me hope...

The last thing this passage reminds me of is the power of regret. Every evening I ask myself the question (in my journal), _"What would you regret, had you met death today?"_ I write down what I might regret in a moment of death that day (along with how I might have come to that situation as a practice of _[negative visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_visualization)_), e.g. I got hit suddenly by a car or something. Dying without regret is such a powerful motivator for me. The thought of looking back at myself in that short moment and not feeling like I was a fool to be unhappy for stupid reasons sounds like a great way to die.

So I implor myself, and you, _Memento Mori_, or, remember how you would like to feel in your last moments. Will it be one filled with regret? Marcus always implors himself to get to it, while he can, while he is not too old, I think, in order that he may not regret the time and virility he (and we) have _today_.
