## Morning {#morning}

In accordance to my Social Duty, I am sharing my thoughts from my morning exercise. I was highly motivated by Chuck Chakrapani's presentation at Stoicon this year (as you will see). I set out this morning re-defining the virtues for myself, to set my focus for the day and week ahead:

### Wisdom: as the lack of foolishness

- A stoic is not a fool, for fools often stumble, fall, and grow frustrated and unhappy
- It would be foolish to fear the unknown, at the risk of doubling your fear
- It would be foolish to try and control something you absolutely have no control over
- All other virtues aim and not being the fool, thus calling for wisdom in them all

### Courage: as a lack of fear

- Replace fear with caution, aware of it, doing only what you can, yet utterly let go of controlling it
- Fearlessness, then, is at the hexrart of Courage
- Since you are not in control of everything, you are called to endure those things

### Justice: as a lack of social duty

- "What is not good for the beehive, is not good for the bee," Marcus A.
- Because we are social beings, it would be foolish to think that an un-healthy society will be of any benefit to you
- Start with your home-life, as it is the first city in which you live
- Make sure and vote!

### Moderation: as a lack of excess

- Moderation is minimalistic at heart, and you will be overtaken by excess if you let it, causing you to stumble and grow frustrated
- Control your imagination, which can inflate your desire for that which is not present, and even in excess

I really liked how Chuck put it, and throughout Stoic week I am going to focus on taking a "chisel away" approach to the virtues as opposed to simply the call to do them. In order to do them, you have to "chisel" away the thing to not do...

## Afternoon {#afternoon}

> Take a few minutes this lunch-time to think of a few ways in which you could make progress towards caring better for yourself, others, or your world. 
> 
> Note down some first steps, things that you could do during this week or the next. 

I have always believed, in order to take care of other people, you have to have sound-mind yourself. And so I am always working on remaining calm and letting go of control. I will, of course, continue to do that...

For others, I will, of course, always begin with my family. Making sure they are happy and that _peace_ is kept within the household, that way we can all be our best selves in the world.

For the world, I will continue to do small thing like recycle, pick up trash when I see it along my way, and appriciate nature deeply.

> Think of one or two larger moves in this direction – broader aims in life that you may have lost sight of in the daily demands on your time and attention. 

One larger move I could do is, for one, VOTE! I neglected participating in politics in my younger years, but this year, and this climate, has shown me it's important to be active by being countetd. A broader move I could make is maybe getting more involved locally, e.g. at my children's school and participating in local government more. All things that are hard to do with two kids, COVID, two working parents, etc. But, are non-the-less still important.

## Evening

> Evening Text for Reflection
>
> Marcus Aurelius thinks about the qualities of his friend, Sextus, which helped Marcus to make progress in learning how to care for himself and others.
> 
> From Sextus [I learnt] kindliness … the idea of living according to nature; seriousness without affectation; perceptiveness in gauging his friends’ needs … the ability to fit in with everyone, so that his company was more pleasant than any kind of flattery, while at the same time he aroused the greatest respect from those who were with him; a secure and methodical discovery and organization of the principles necessary for life; never to give the impression of anger or any other passion but to be at once completely free of passion and yet full of affection for other people; to speak well of others without making a fuss about it, and deep learning without ostentation. - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

### Reflection

One of my favorite parts of [the Meditations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations) is in the very first book where he honors his family, friends, and teachers for the qualities they shown him over the years. Many of the greater Stoic qualities are expounded in book one alone. I used to scrub over this part of the book early on, but the more I re-read _the Meditations_ the more the qualities of those _other than Marcus himeself_ stand out to me.

In my life, I often long for mentors. But, thankfully I have great teachers, e.g. the very _"great four"_ (Marcus, Epicitus, Seneca, and Musonious) for being my teachers. And, for modern-day Stoic heros like [Massimo Pigliucci](https://twitter.com/mpigliucci), [Ryan Holiday](https://ryanholiday.net), and [Chris Fisher](https://bit.ly/37ukzii), among many many more that are too numerous to count here for exemplifying qualities I very much admire.

I am also reminded of the _new Polis_ in which we live in, _The Internet_. And, how much it has flourished as much as a great city or nation that I am forever greatful for and indebted to. I'm reminded how much I need to give back to this new city.

Lastly I'm reminded to look at the people I maybe wouldn't praise, but otherwise learned a great deal from. The one's who maybe didn't teach me great and profound things, but taught me the small, but necessary, things about life; even if it was not what to do. To them I am also equally as greatful, and look to honor as well in my thoughts tonight.
