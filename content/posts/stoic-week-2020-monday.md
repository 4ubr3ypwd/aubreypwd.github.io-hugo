In accordance to my Social Duty, I am sharing my thoughts from my morning exercise. I was highly motivated by Chuck Chakrapani's presentation at Stoicon this year (as you will see). I set out this morning re-defining the virtues for myself, to set my focus for the day and week ahead:

## Wisdom: as the lack of foolishness

- A stoic is not a fool, for fools often stumble, fall, and grow frustrated and unhappy
- It would be foolish to fear the unknown, at the risk of doubling your fear
- It would be foolish to try and control something you absolutely have no control over
- All other virtues aim and not being the fool, thus calling for wisdom in them all

## Courage: as a lack of fear

- Replace fear with caution, aware of it, doing only what you can, yet utterly let go of controlling it
- Fearlessness, then, is at the heart of Courage
- Since you are not in control of everything, you are called to endure those things

## Justice: as a lack of social duty

- "What is not good for the beehive, is not good for the bee," Marcus A.
- Because we a social beings, it would be foolish to think that an un-healthy society will be of any benefit to you
- Start with your home-life, as it is the first city in which you live
- Make sure and vote today!

## Moderation: as a lack of excess

- Moderation is minimalistic at heart, and you will be overtaken by excess if you let it, causing you to stumble and grow frustrated

â€”

I really liked how Chuck put it, and throughout Stoic week I am going to focus on taking a "chisel away" approach to the virtues as opposed to simply the call to do them. In order to do them, you have to "chisel" away the thing to not do...
