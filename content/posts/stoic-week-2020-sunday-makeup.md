## Morning {#morning}

>  The works of the gods are full of providence, and the works of fortune are not separate from nature or the interweaving and intertwining of the things governed by providence. Everything flows from there. Further factors are necessity and the benefit of the whole universe, of which you are a part. What is brought by the nature of the whole and what maintains that nature is good for each part of nature. Just as the changes in the elements maintain the universe so too do the changes in the compounds. â€” Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.3

The first thing I thought of when reading this is about _providence_. I used to be an atheist, maybe a bit agnostic at times, but either way I sure didn't believe in an all powerful god watching over and thinking about us. But, now, I do believe Nature is. Maybe not watching. Maybe not thinking about us (those are human qualities, remember). But, if you think about the idea that the Cosmos is orderly (not some chaotic soup), alive (as in it's going to keep making the Cosmos), and resulted in you and me being here... has something to say about how Nature is doing _something_ to ensure that out galaxy is here, our sun is here, that our Earth is here and that you and me are alive thinking and feeling creatures. So sure, maybe I don't believe in a typical personality-driven god (in fact I think I honor Nature _more_ by not), but I definitely believe in Nature and it's creative quality in the Cosmos.

So, now when my friends ask me if I believe in God &mdash; well yeah &mdash; but this God is one-and-the-same with Nature. And I do think Nature deserves to be reverenced for _our own_ nature. Before my Stoicism, I used to be a very non-spiritual person, and when I found Stoicism I thought it was _very_ compatible with that, and it was. But suprisingly for me Stoicism made me a more spiritual person over time. _Because_ of the notion of Nature. Not that it made me beleive in Zeus and the pantheon or anything, but that I understood that Nature _is_ alive, _is_ aimed at something (order, you, me, life), and _did_ create me and my mind and even the human idea of Virtue, and so on. It's an active element in the entire Cosmos, and for me it's become something I've quite developed a _spiritual_ relationship with.
