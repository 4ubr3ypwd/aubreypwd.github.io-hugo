## Morning {#morning}

>  If you can find anything in human life better than justice, truthfulness, self-control, courage turn to it with all your heart and enjoy the supreme good that you have found but if you find all other things to be trivial and valueless in comparison with virtue, give no room to anything else, since, once you turn towards that and divert from your proper path, you will no longer be able without inner conflict to give the highest honour to what is properly good. It is not right to set up as a rival to the rational and social good anything alien to its nature, such as the praise of the many, or positions of power, wealth, or enjoyment of pleasures. â€“ Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 3.6

This week has been very eye-opening in reguard to the virtues, specifically the cardinal ones. With Chuck Chakrapani's method of chiseling away what is not Wisdom, Courage, Justice and Moderation, they taken a bit a a new role in my Stoicism. I've always been a bit dis-satisfied with the cardinal virtues, because in their call to _do them_ I have always been left with wondering, _well, what should I do?_

Thanks to Chuck Chakrapani's method, sometimes you just need to be told _what not to do_ to make it all clear. And so I am going to write (and remind myself) what this method is about.

### The Chisel Away Method

So, the focus is all on what _not_ to do or _not_ to be:

- For Wisdom, don't be the fool
- For Courage, don't do anything with fear
- For Justice, don't be selfish
- For Moderation, don't be excessive

Now, there's a bit more to it than that. The way that Chuck builds a unique relationship of the latter three, to the first (Wisdom) is the most clarifying:

#### Don't be the fool

The ultimate rule is: _Stoics are not fools._

And so, looking at _Courage_, it would be foolish, then, to be afraid of something:

1. That is not in your control
2. That has not yet come to pass, effectively doubling your fear

For _Justice_, it would be foolish to think that if you did not take care of your community, that it would be of any benefit to you; therefore take care of your communitie(s) for _your own benefit._

For _Moderiation_ (or Temperance), it would be foolish to think that managing more and more things (whether that be food, posessions, or indulgences) will be easier for you the more you obtain. 

#### The Reward

And so, you can see that all of the Cardinal Vitrues call you to Wisdom, to simply not be the fool, to use your reason to finally find the reward of exacting this call: [_Eudaimonia_](Eudaimonia), or _happiness_.

The last thing I want to expound on is that, in my exeperience as a Stoic, I have found that the reward of not being the fool, or being a good person, _is it's own reward_. I have studied exactly _why_ I put myself through this, and it's _one simple thing for me_:

When I look in the mirror, I'm happy with _myself_. That, I think, is the ultimate reward of being a Stoic, and why I work on it every day.
